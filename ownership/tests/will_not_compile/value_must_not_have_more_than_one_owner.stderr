error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `a`
 --> tests/will_not_compile/value_must_not_have_more_than_one_owner.rs:4:19

2 |     let a = String::from("Hello World!");
  |         - move occurs because `a` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     let b = a; //variable b now owns the value
  |             - value moved here
4 |     println!("a = {a}"); //a is no longer valid
  |                   ^^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable

3 |     let b = a.clone(); //variable b now owns the value
